GPP App
================

The Dutch government wishes to be open and transparent to its citizens. To achieve this,
the law `Wet open overheid (Woo)`_ was established, 
requiring government organisations to actively and digitally publish their documents and thus create *public records*.

To support govenment organisations in executing this law, the "Generic Publications Platform Woo (GPP-Woo)" was developed. 
This platform is an aggregation of four components, including the 'GPP App' component. This component provides public servants with a web-based user interface to manulaly upload and publish public records.

For a full publication platform, two additional components are required:

* `GPP Publications <https://github.com/GPP-Woo/GPP-publicatiebank>`_, a storage repository and JSON API to manage and expose public records including their metadata.
* `GPP Citizen Portal <https://github.com/GPP-Woo/GPP-burgerportaal>`_, a component which provides citizens with a website where they can browse and search through public records.

All components are designed in line with the `Common Ground`_ model.
